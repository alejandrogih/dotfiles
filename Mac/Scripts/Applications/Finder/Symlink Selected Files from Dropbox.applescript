## find which files are selected in Finder
# XXX single file selection
#tell application "Finder" to get posix path of (the selection as alias)

# Supporting multiple selections requires a bit more code
# See: http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=33101

	if selection â‰  "" then
		set filelist to (selection)
		repeat with anElm in filelist
			set selectedFilePaths to selectedFilePaths & POSIX path of (anElm as alias)
		end repeat
		#set AppleScript'\''s text item delimiters to linefeed
		#posixList as Unicode text
	end if
end tell

# create symlinks from Dropbox folder, then reveal the symlink in Finder
repeat with f in selectedFilePaths
	do shell script "
