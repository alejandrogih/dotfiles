Mac Configurations
==================

## Tweak.sh
This shell script includes some preference tweaks I use on my Macs.


## Terminal.app
Open any `.terminal` file to load configuration into Mac OS X's Terminal app.


## KeyRemap4MacBook .xml
[KeyRemap4MacBook][] is a great tool that allows you to remap keyboard in OS X.
I'm using it to remap left command as option key except a few Mac key
combinations in Terminal.app, and Esc to switch back to English IM in Vim to
make life easier.


## Many Scripts
In the `Scripts` directory, there are various AppleScripts I use for many
purposes.  I bind them to global and application-specific shortcut keys with
[FastScripts][].  Some might be useful as-is, others might need to be tailored
to fit your need.  Feel free to copy and modify them, or include in your
scripts.

### Automatically Organizing Window Layouts
I'm using `Adapt to Environment.applescript` with [Control Plane][] for
repositioning and resizing windows as I move around.


## BetterTouchToolGestures
[BetterTouchTool][] is another awesome tool that lets me use trackpad on a
whole new level.


## [Change Default Font Fallbacks][MacOSXDefaultFontFallbacksChanger]
`DefaultFontFallbacksChanger` directory contains a `.command` script which
allows you to switch your Mac's default font fallbacks.
