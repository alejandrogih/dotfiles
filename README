Title: netj's dotfiles

== How to use (for the first time) ==
1. Download `[update]` by running `wget http://sparcs.org/~netj/dotfiles/update`
2. Run `bash update` to retrieve these files into `~/.dotfiles/`.
3. Run `~/.dotfiles/install` and and enter `y` for those you want to install.
4. You may delete the `update` file you've downloaded.

== Notes ==
* Having [http://git-scm.com/ Git] installed is recommended.
* You can run `~/.dotfiles/update` later to merge new stuffs here if Git is
  installed.
* Update still works without Git (if you have
  [http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/ wget]), but your precious modifications
  will be overwritten. :(
* Simply use `cd ~/.dotfiles; git format-patch sparcs/master` to send me your mo
  want to.
* I use a [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.php zlib/libpng style
  See `[COPYRIGHT]` for more information about using these files.

== Warning ==
* Use entirely at your own risk -- no warranty is expressed or implied.
* Playing with your dotfiles is a very time consuming activity.
